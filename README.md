# Sanger sequencing mate-pair based assembly pipeline
 A set of programs for mate-based assembly for Sanger type sequences. 
## Summary
This assembly pipeline uses several existing tools for calling ((phrap/phred),  cleaning (Lucy/Seqclean) and assembling (CAP3) of long EST reads with mate pair information. The reason for this pipeline is that, in the case of the sandfly Phlebotomus papatasi, usig cap3 in a two step assembly, where the first step deals only with mate-pairs resulted in an improved assembly.
